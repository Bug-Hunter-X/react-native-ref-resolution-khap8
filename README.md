# React Native Ref Issue: Unexpected undefined/null

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native: encountering `undefined` or `null` values when using refs to access component properties or methods, even after the component has seemingly mounted. This often results from accessing refs too early in the component lifecycle or race conditions.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where attempting to access a ref's value immediately leads to an error.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this situation.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected approach, ensuring that the ref is accessed only after the component has fully mounted and the relevant data is available.
