In React Native, the most common cause for a ref returning null or undefined is premature access. Instead of directly using the ref in the component's render method, it's recommended to access it within lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, or to use the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array (to mimic `componentDidMount` functionality) to guarantee it's accessed after the component is fully mounted and the ref has been assigned a value.

Here's how you might fix the issue using `useEffect`:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      // Access myRef.current safely here, it's guaranteed to be defined
      console.log(myRef.current.someProperty); 
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text ref={myRef}>Some Text</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
This revised approach guarantees that `myRef.current` is accessed only after the component has finished rendering, preventing `undefined` or `null` errors.
